# Phone Book Directory
In this project, I made a Phone Book Directory using the map data structure which stores the phone numbers of people. It has the following functions:
- adding a name and contact of a person
- removing a name and their contact
- editing a name or a contact of a person
- searching for a name and displaying their contact number
- displaying all the names along with their contact numbers

I have used the map data structure to hold all the names and their contact numbers. Using map also helps me to arrange the names in alphabetical order. We use the name of the person as the key and the phone number as its value. Since we are using ordered_map in c++, the time complexity for find, insert or delete is `O(log n)` .
